We are building a typical Server-Side APIs from Spaceflight News Articles and A background Image from NASA.

AS A Astrologist Fan
I WANT to see news articles
SO THAT I can stay up to date with the happenings in our universe.

GIVEN a dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for an article
THEN I am presented with various articles that I can choose from to read
WHEN I am choosing my article we have a stunning view of what is showing from the NASA Website
